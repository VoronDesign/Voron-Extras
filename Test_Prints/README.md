## Test Prints
These are some of the test files you can use to help dial in your printer before printing your printer parts.

The parts are representative of the tolerances and fits that are crucial to an easy and smooth build of your printer. Print them in the orientation shown for best results. The thread tests should thread together smoothly with zero binding.

The filament card and caddy are both test prints as well as a good way to have a sample of each color filament you own for use later in project planning.
