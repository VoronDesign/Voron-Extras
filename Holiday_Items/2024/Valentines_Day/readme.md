### Valentine's (Vorontine's) Day Gift Box
A nice, small, and quick to print heart-shaped storage device.

#### Why a .3mf?
We've shared a .3mf file for this item because we feel it looks the best when printed in multiple colors. This can be done easily with an MMU device, or a couple manual filament swaps if your slicer is configured to do it.
You can also split the top of the box into objects and remove the logo if you prefer a bridged logo look.
