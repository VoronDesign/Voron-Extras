### Summer Coaster Competition
This is a set of 3 coasters and a practical caddy to store them in. Print them, and put under glass or can of your favorite drink to keep condensed moisture from dripping down to the surface.

We love mods and customizations - we included a blank coaster. Simply use modifiers in slicer to expose infill, negative space, or emboss to make your own!

Recommended print settings:
Material: We recommend printing from material with higher temperature resistance if coasters will be used outside in the sun.
Layer height: 0.2mm 
Extrusion width: 0.4mm 
Wall count: 4 
Solid top/bottom layers: 5

Cheers!


#### Why a .3mf?
We've shared a .3mf file for this item as well as .STLs because we feel it looks the best when printed in multiple colors. This can be done easily with an MMU device.
